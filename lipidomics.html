            <h1>Lipidomics Studies on Plasmalogen Reduction in Neurodegenerative Diseases</h1>
            <div class="section-spacing"></div>
            <p>Our lipidomics research focuses on understanding the biochemical changes in erythrocyte membranes associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). Recent studies have identified a significant reduction in ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsPE) and phosphatidylcholine levels in erythrocytes of affected individuals, which may serve as potential biomarkers for disease progression.</p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decreased Plasmalogens:</strong> Erythrocyte ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsPE) levels are significantly reduced in AD, PD, and CAD patients compared to healthy controls.</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphatidylcholine Reduction:</strong> Alongside PlsPE, phosphatidylcholine levels also decrease, while phosphatidylethanolamine remains unchanged.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Sphingomyelin:</strong> The reduction in PlsPE and phosphatidylcholine is accompanied by an increase in sphingomyelin (SM) within total phospholipids.</li>
                <li><strong>Potential Biomarkers:</strong> These lipid alterations suggest common pathological mechanisms across different chronic diseases, highlighting their potential as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and progression monitoring.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Implications for Disease Progression</h2>
            <p>The consistent reduction of plasmalogens and phosphatidylcholine in erythrocyte membranes across AD, PD, and CAD indicates a shared pathological pathway that may contribute to disease progression. By leveraging high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and advanced lipidomics techniques, our ongoing research aims to further elucidate these mechanisms and validate lipid profiles as reliable indicators of disease states.</p>

            <h2>Current Research</h2>
            <p>Using comprehensive lipidomics studies, we are investigating the dynamic changes in lipid composition during the progression of AD, PD, and CAD. Our goal is to establish a detailed lipidomic signature that correlates with disease stages, facilitating early diagnosis and personalized therapeutic strategies.</p>

            <!-- New Section: Clinical Benefits of Oral Ingestion of Natural Plasmalogens -->
            <h2>Clinical Benefits of Oral Ingestion of Natural Plasmalogens (Extracted from Scallop)</h2>
            <div class="section-spacing"></div>
            <p>Recent clinical studies have explored the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered plasmalogens extracted from scallop in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. These studies have shown promising results in improving cognitive function and alleviating clinical symptoms in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>

            <h3>Study Overview</h3>
            <p>A 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving patients with MCI (n = 178) and mild AD (n = 98). Additionally, a 12-week open-label study was performed for patients with moderate AD (n = 57) and severe AD (n = 18), along with a 24-week open-label study for patients with PD (n = 10). The results demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive function and other clinical symptoms, accompanied by elevated blood plasmalogen levels. Importantly, no adverse events were reported during the trials.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Cognitive Function:</strong> Patients receiving oral plasmalogens showed significant enhancement in cognitive abilities compared to the placebo group.</li>
                <li><strong>Elevation of Blood Plasmalogen Levels:</strong> Oral ingestion led to increased levels of ethanolamine plasmalogen in plasma and erythrocytes.</li>
                <li><strong>No Adverse Events:</strong> The treatment was well-tolerated with no reported side effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Biomarker Potential:</strong> Baseline plasmalogen levels correlated with disease severity, suggesting their use as biomarkers for assessing the progression of AD and PD.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The administration of natural plasmalogens extracted from scallop appears to offer clinical benefits for individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. These findings support the potential use of plasmalogens as both therapeutic agents and biomarkers for disease severity, paving the way for new approaches in the management of AD, MCI, and PD.</p>

            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>It has been reported in recent years that blood levels of plasmalogens (Pls) are decreased in various diseases. None of those reports, however, conducted any clinical trials to examine the effect of Pls on those diseases. This article describes our recent report on the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered Pls in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). A 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in patients with MCI (n = 178) and mild AD (n = 98). The study design for moderate AD (n = 57) and severe AD (n = 18) was a 12-week open-labeled, and the design for patients with PD (n = 10) was a 24-week open-labeled. They showed a significant improvement in cognitive function and other clinical symptoms with elevation of the blood Pls levels. No adverse events were reported. The baseline levels of plasma ethanolamine plasmalogen and erythrocyte ethanolamine plasmalogen in MCI, AD, and PD were significantly lower than those of normal aged. The degree of reduction in the blood Pls levels was in the order of MCI ≺ mild AD ≺ moderate AD ≺ severe AD ≺ PD. The findings suggest that the blood levels of Pls may be a beneficial biomarker for assessing AD severity. Based on these results, we have proposed a new hypothesis for the etiology of AD and other neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
